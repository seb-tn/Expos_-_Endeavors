Open your ChatGPT or LLM Image Gen Software copy the contents of the brickify Prompt and then click on submit.

YOU WILL GET AN ERROR as it will ask you to replace everything in the PROMPT in brackets with additional information.

Please read before entering, some information or generative items may not apply and It's best practice to ONLY submit information relevant to the desired output.
I.e. if your Model will be Female, perhaps a beard inclusion in the prompt may not be relevant.

Optional things such as the Pet, or props are not required.

Please make sure to use ONLY images already found in the public domain or images you feel comfortable being uploaded to a remote server.
This model requires at least 3 reference images for better generation.

Please keep in mind that you may need to tweak specific items several times before a generated output is accurate or acceptable.  I.e. I did for the shoes.
